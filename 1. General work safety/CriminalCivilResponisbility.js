Title: Criminal/civil responsibility

Definition: A crime is classified as a behaviour which is punishable by criminal law.

"An act can only be punished if the punishability was determined by law before the act was committed."
More precisely, a crime is an action or failure to act which harms a legal good, i.e an asset, good, or interest protected by law.

A human action cannot be considered criminal if, at the time it was done, it was not considered illegal by criminal law



In law there is a difference between...


Intent

Intent is understood as referring to somebody knowingly and purposely causing harm.


Slight negligence

Slight negligence applies when appropriate care is not taken, and no intentional carelessness has occurred.

Gross negligence

Gross negligence applies when care is disregarded to a large degree. If somebody fails to take even the most obvious, most convenient, and easiest steps towards care, they can be held grossly negligent.

A crime is classified as an act or omission causing harmful or stressful consequences for another person or property.

Title: Responsibility

Definition: Liability describes a situation where a person is legally responsible for a breach of an obligation imposed by the law, with the obligation to undergo sanctions specified in law.

We can all be found liable under any of the following conditions:

after a breach of current legislation
when a person is harmed or an object is damaged
when we are proven to be personally at fault
when an act or omission causes harm
if the task was in a personal area of responsibility
There are three types of liability

Criminal liability
This impacts the person directly (e.g. imprisonment, fines) for a breach of criminal regulations.

Civil liability
This impacts the property of the employer and the employee.

Administrative liability
This affects the responsibility of the employees towards the public administration and impacts the property of the public employees.

Title: Sanctions for breaches of duty

Within occupational health and safety the punitive stipulations of Legislative Decree 81/2008 are relevant, but the provisions contained within the Criminal Code or the Civil Code may also be applicable.

From the Criminal Code



Art. 437 – Deliberate omission or removal of precautionary measures against accidents at work

Art. 451 – Negligent omission to act on precautionary measures against disasters or accidents at work

Art. 589 – Involuntary manslaughter

Art. 590 – Personal injury as a result of negligence

From the Civil Code


Art. 2043 – compensation for damages caused by unlawful acts

Every intentional or negligent action which illegally causes harm to another person obliges the person responsible to provide compensation for the harm caused.

Art. 2050 – liability for carrying out hazardous activities

If somebody harms another person in the course of carrying out an activity which is hazardous by its nature or by reason of the tools employed, they are obliged to provide compensation for the harm caused, unless they can prove that they took suitable measures to prevent the harm from occurring.

Art. 2087 – protection of working conditions

In the course of business, the entrepreneur shall be required to adopt all measures which, depending on the particular nature of the work, on experience, and on technical knowledge, are necessary to ensure protection of the physical integrity and moral welfare of the employees.

Legislative Decree 81/2008 establishes the sanctions for breaches of law by the various people involved in safety and health organisation. There are different sanctions established for, among others, employers, managers, supervisors, employees, and appointed doctors.


The regulatory bodies are responsible for monitoring organisations’ adherence to regulations for health protection and safety at work and issuing sanctions where necessary.



Employees can also be sanctioned by regulatory bodies if they engage in unsafe behaviour.

Employers, who are responsible for occupational health and safety protection in their company, are permitted and required to issue sanctions (warnings, suspension from work, dismissal) to employees who behave unsafely.


A criminal or administrative penalty always applies to the person who is guilty of the offence through commission or omission.

When someone or something is harmed or damaged, civil law stipulates that there is a duty to compensate.

INAIL may also recover any sick pay paid to the employee.
