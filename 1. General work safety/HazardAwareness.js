Title: Hazard awareness

Accidents cause human suffering and financial loss.
Being aware of hazards is an important first step towards preventing accidents.

Reasons we might not react to a hazard we are aware of

We do not identify the hazard as such
We are distracted
We are not interested in it because it does not have an impact on us (it has nothing to do with me, nothing will happen)
We identify the hazard, but underestimate the situation (it’s not that serious, I don’t have to do anything)
Safe behaviour is expressed by actively doing or not doing things in order to protect one’s own health and the health of others, and to promote active co-operation for the constant improvement of occupational health and safety.

Safe behaviour is characterised by the anticipation of a possible hazard, which means that people are actively working against the hazard (dealing with risks).

But why do we sometimes find it so difficult to behave safely?

Title: We lull ourselves into a false sense of security

Identifying a hazard is an essential prerequisite for considering the possible consequences behaviour might have for safety.
When people believe nothing bad could actually happen to them, they feel safe.
We often lull ourselves into a false sense of security and therefore have no motivation to protect ourselves
We do not feel endangered because

we do not understand the hazards

This could be the result of missing knowledge.

our hazard awareness is limited

Conditions such as colour blindness or being heard of hearing, impairment due to the consumption of intoxicating substances as well as tiredness and monotony can reduce somebody’s hazard awareness

accidents happen rarely
Health and bodily integrity are therefore widely taken for granted.

we underestimate the risks

People underestimate the risks of familiar or ordinary activities, for example cleaning or working with hand tools.

we view the possible damage as low

Tripping is a typical example of an accident for which the consequences are underestimated.

we overestimate our own abilities
For example, if people assume that they would have enough time to catch a falling slab and thereby underestimate the forces involved. Sadly, there are always people who fatally overestimate their abilities.

we do not want to know anything about the hazards

Information about impending hazards is often ignored or trivialised.
This happens especially when one does not know how to protect oneself from a hazard or sees it as not feasible.

This tendency towards trivialisation makes it easier to cope with everyday life. It would really be too stressful to constantly notice all the hazards surrounding us.

Title: Safe working practices and our experiences

Safe working practices become habitual when one has mostly positive experiences with them.

Good and bad experiences affect our behaviour. If a behaviour is successful, we view it as advantageous. We remember it and repeat it in other similar situations. Over time, it becomes a habit.

If the behaviour is unsuccessful, the opposite happens. Situations and behaviours with which we have negative experiences will be avoided in future.

Safe working practices which are proven every day will be maintained. This is the case when a safe behaviour can also be applied in a critical situation or under time pressure, or when we receive recognition for it from co-workers and supervisors.

Negative experiences such as reduced performance, being viewed or remarked on negatively by co-workers and supervisors, will discourage safe behaviour.

The cost of safe working practices seems too high because[C

other needs matter more

Working safely can seem complicated, and it sometimes is. It takes more time or is uncomfortable (helmets, protective goggles, protective masks, etc.)
For example, if we are worried that our expected performance will be impeded, it is very likely that we will reject safe behaviour.

people tend to care more about short-term consequences than long-term ones

Hearing protection is uncomfortable now. Damage to hearing may not appear for 20 years.

fear of negative consequences is high

The fear of being laughed at by co-workers while using mobile scaffolding seems more important than being able to work more safely, quickly, and comfortably on the scaffolding.

the likelihood of expected consequences is a deciding factor in cost-benefit analysis

Accidents happen rarely. Therefore, the likelihood that safety will be endangered is assumed to be low.

So, it is believed to be unimportant in these considerations: “Should I turn the machine off before repairing the malfunction?” Here safety and productivity are placed in opposition to each other. Turning off the machine definitely has negative implications for productivity.

Endangering safety might be classified as a much less likely consequence.

unmet expectations are not heavily scrutinised

“The others would be angry if I went back to fetch my safety goggles, instead of just working quickly without them.”

Some assumptions are particularly exempt from scrutiny. Maybe the situation would have unfolded differently. Maybe the boss would have praised them for thinking about eye protection at the right time.

Title: Safety conscious behaviour

Safety conscious behaviour or rather careless behaviour depends on:

1. how the potential hazard is estimated: if we view a situation as safe, we take less care of our safety.
2. the benefits of an unsafe behaviour: if an unsafe behaviour seems to be highly useful (e.g. time saving) and the negative consequences tolerable, we will tend to continue that behaviour.
3. the lack of consequences: if unsafe behaviours have no negative consequences in general, they will be repeated under similar conditions and eventually become a habit.
4. any re-evaluation: if we become aware that our behaviour is connected to a level of risk above what we are willing to tolerate, the chance that we will change our behaviour is good.
5. “penalties”: if an unsafe behaviour has negative consequences (an accident or sanctions according to employment law) we generally change it immediately.

Some important prerequisites for behaving safely are
KNOWLEDGE = knowing the hazards, protective measures, and behavioural regulations
ABILITY = the availability of organisational and technical frameworks
MOTIVATION = a positive attitude towards safety and being safety conscious
