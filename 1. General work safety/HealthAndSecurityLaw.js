Title: Safety and health organisation

Safety and health organisation aims to ensure and constantly improve health and safety at work through precise planning and optimal cooperation between company management and all employees.

A functioning safety and health organisation is a prerequisite for the effective execution of legal duties
Safety and health organisation

In this diagram, you will find a basic but generally applicable “safety and health organisation organigram” with all the various people involved.

Depending on the size and structure of a company, there will be differences between this organigram and how it works in each specific company.

Ask your employer or manager for more information!

The provincial administration and the schools in South Tyrol have their own occupational health and safety organisation.

In the next slide you will find an example of an organisation chart in the provincial administration and in a school.

It is responsible for the personnel of the departments of the provincial administration, the provincial vocational schools, the music schools, the music conservatory, kindergartens, as well as for the teaching and non-teaching staff of public schools.

For the majority of the organisations mentioned above, staff members from the central office take on the role of the coordinator of the health and safety committee

The managers/employers appoint the health and safety committee operators for each respective area of responsibility. The operators’ main tasks are to support the manager and employer in the implementation of occupational health and safety provisions. They also function as contact persons for employees.

Some provincial departments and some schools have an internal health and safety committee, in which they have their own internal coordinator.

- Appointed doctor

Doctors of the Occupational Medicine Department of the Local Health Authority of South Tyrol function as the appointed doctors for the Provincial administration and the schools of South Tyrol.
The relevant appointed doctors are based in Bolzano - via del Ronco no. 3 - and can be reached at the following telephone number: 0471/907900.

- Premises officer

The person who supervises the usage, preservation, and functionality of provincial property [1]
In this context the premises officer is designated by the provincial government as an employer with regard to the tasks performed as part of emergency management and building security.

- Emergency response team members

The emergency response team members’ main tasks are listed in Decision of the Provincial Government no. 488/1999; they may only be carried out when doing so does not put their health or life in danger. The tasks are as follows:

Title: The employer

Definition:
The employer is the provider of work in the employment relationship with an employee, or in any case, depending on the type and structure of an organisation, the person on whom the employee depends for work, who takes responsibility for the organisation or unit, and who has the authority to make decisions with regard to the organisation and its financial resources. [1]

Anybody who provides work to an employee can be considered an employer.

The employer is the primary person responsible for health and safety in the workplace. They must provide for the suitable organisation of occupational health and safety in their area of responsibility and provide their employees with any necessary equipment.

Duties of the employer according to Legislative Decree 81/2008

Carry out the risk assessment in the company

The employer assesses all risks to safety (accidents) and health (illnesses) depending on the types of activity in the organisation

The risk assessment is the basis for health and safety at work and plays an essential role in the reduction of work-related accidents and illnesses.
A risk assessment is commonly understood to be the evaluation of risks to health and safety that an employee might face at work.
What this means is a systematic investigation into all aspects of work, which examines:
• what could cause harm or damage,
• whether the hazards can be removed and, if not,
• which preventive and protective measures are in place and which should be taken.[CE1]

During the assessment, the following elements must also be taken into account and inspected:

the work tools
the various substances and preparations in use
the furnishing of the workplace
the risks arising from work-related stress
the risks to pregnant and breastfeeding employees
the risks dependent on age, gender, or place of origin
Use state-of-the-art techniques to eliminate or minimise risks and hazards at the source

The concept “state-of-the-art” is meant in the widest sense.

Protective measures will generally have to conform to advances in technology and working methods.
It is possible that a protective measure could be regarded as insufficient as time passes. Anybody who lacks “state-of-the-art” proficiency must acquire this proficiency, for example by contacting the coordinator of the health and safety committee, by consulting an expert, or by studying appropriate documents (regulations, directives, leaflets, publications).

Substitute dangerous work tools with safe or less dangerous ones

Work tools are tools, appliances, machines, and systems used by employees at work.

Before providing work tools, the employer must examine:

whether the work tools are suitable for their intended use
whether the work tools can be used for their intended purpose
whether there are remaining hazards to the health and safety of the employee through the intended use of the work tools, and which measures would be suitable to reduce the risk as much as possible
that the work tools and systems are installed according to the manufacturers’ instructions
that they are properly maintained, in order to meet the legal requirements in the long term

Hazards to the safety and health of the employee while using work tools could derive for example from dangerous movements, hazard zones (e.g. areas where machinery could expose the employee to danger, for example through cutting, crushing, pinching, trapping, or impact), vibrations, noise, hot or very cold surfaces, harmful emissions, electromagnetic fields as well as ionising and non-ionising radiation.

When using a particular work tool could potentially be hazardous for employees, the employer must ensure that only employees who are officially responsible for that tool may do so.
Take the principles of ergonomics into account in the design of workplaces and the implementation of work processes

Workplaces must meet numerous hygiene and safety related standards. These will depend on the type of workplace in question. For example, the regulations applied to crafting workrooms and manufacturing facilities will be different to those applied to administrative workplaces.

In general all workplaces should be designed with the protection of the employees’ health and safety in mind. This includes workstations, technical facilities, and work tools as well as factors such as indoor air quality and lighting, operational procedures in general, or structural measures.

Workplaces, work tools and systems must be periodically monitored and maintained, taking into account all safety provisions.

Give collective protective equipment priority over personal protective equipment

Collective protection, which includes barriers, railings to prevent falls, automated systems and so on, have priority over personal protective equipment.

If it is not possible to fully separate the employee from a health hazard or the risk of an accident, the employer must provide appropriate personal protective equipment, which must be kept in good condition.

Use warning and safety signs
The employer must resort to safety signs in the case that risk cannot be avoided or sufficiently reduced through measures, methods, organisation systems or collective protective measures.

Safety signs are signs that enable the communication of an occupational health and safety message with regard to a particular object, activity, or situation, using a signboard, a color, a light, a verbal communication, or a hand signal

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: The emergency response team

The employees who the employer or manager make responsible for the implementation of measures for fire prevention, firefighting, for the evacuation of the workplace in the case of serious and immediate risk, for rescue or first aid, or in any case for emergency management, form a group that is generally known as the emergency response team (ERT).
These employees must attend specific training courses in first aid or fire safety and fire prevention.

First-aiders

First-aiders are responsible for performing first aid on injured people. They are required to complete training in emergency medical care. In case of an emergency they must provide first aid and contact the emergency services.

Responsible persons for fire safety

Responsible persons for fire safety are charged with implementing organisational measures for fire prevention and firefighting as well as the evacuation of the workplace.

The emergency response team’s primary tasks

The ERT’s primary tasks are listed below; they can only be carried out when doing so does not put their health or life in danger.

Carry out an initial evaluation of the emergency at hand
Provide helpers and the internal emergency operations centre with any necessary information
Provide first aid to injured people

In buildings:
- Coordinate and lead the evacuation of all people in the building
- Check that all rooms on their floor (or in their area) have been evacuated
- Ensure that disabled people receive appropriate support
- Complete all further tasks that are specified within the emergency plan

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: The Health and Safety Committee

Definition:
The health and safety committee includes all people, systems, and tools, both within and without an organisation, that promote and ensure the protection of employees and prevention of work-related risks. [1]

The employer must establish a health and safety committee in an enterprise or company.
The health and safety committee is comprised of the coordinator of the health and safety committee and the health and safety committee operators.
Employers can take leadership of the health and safety committee themselves or assign somebody from within or without the organisation to the role.
Anyone appointed as coordinator or operator within the health and safety committee must have the skills and qualifications legally required for their role.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: The manager

Definition:
A person who, within their remit and depending on their task, implements the instructions of the employer, while organising and monitoring work activities [1].

With the exception of the duties of carrying out the risk assessment and appointing the coordinator of the health and safety committee, the employer can delegate all other tasks to the manager
The manager is responsible for the realisation of occupational health and safety goals set by the employer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: The appointed doctor

Definition: The appointed doctor is a doctor who has specific qualifications, works with the employer to carry out the risk assessment, and is tasked with carrying out medical surveillance [1].
The appointed doctor is appointed by the employer when the risk assessment highlights the presence of specific risks to the health of the employee and the associated need for medical surveillance.

Duties of the appointed doctor:

works together with the employer and the health and safety committee on the risk assessment and on the implementation of measures for health protection and for the mental and bodily integrity of the employee
plans and carries out medical surveillance on the basis of medical examination protocols and depending on the specific risks
compiles, updates, and stores a health and risk record for each employee examined
transfers all medical documentation at their disposal to the employer upon termination of their contract
provides the employee with a copy of all health and risk records upon the termination of their employment contract and supplies the employee with the necessary information for storing it

reports on the results of the medical surveillance during the periodic workplace safety meetings and provides information on the relevant measures to be taken in the workplace for the prevention of damage to health
inspects the workplace in collaboration with the health and safety committee
assists with the provision of information and training to employees
Medical surveillance

Medical surveillance is carried out when employees are found to be exposed to particular health risks on the basis of a risk assessment.

Medical surveillance primarily consists of:
Preventive medical check-ups

Preventive medical check-ups examine the possible health risks to which employees are exposed in the course of the work to which they are assigned, as well their suitability for their specific tasks
Regular medical check-ups

Regular medical check-ups serve as an assessment of the employees’ state of health and as an evaluation of their suitability for the specific tasks they have been assigned.
These check-ups normally take place once a year, unless otherwise required by law. The frequency of these check-ups can be altered by the appointed doctor on the basis of the risk assessment
Medical check-ups

Medical check-ups happen:

at the request of the employee, provided the appointed doctor can see a need for medical surveillance connected to the specific professional risks or the health conditions of the employee
when the employee’s task changes, in order to assess their suitability for their specific task
before resuming work after health-related absences lasting more than 60 days in a row, to examine an employee’s suitability for their area of responsibility
On the basis of the results from the medical check-up, the appointed doctor will make one of the following rulings:

fit for work
partially, temporarily, or permanently fit for work, with provisions or limitations
temporarily unfit for work
permanently unfit for work

The ruling is communicated to both the employer and the employee.

The employee can appeal the appointed doctor’s ruling within 30 days of its communication at the provincial supervisory authority (the Medical Labour Inspectorate of the Local Health Authority of South Tyrol: Ispettorato medico del lavoro - Azienda sanitaria dell’Alto Adige).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: The supervisor

Definition:
The person who, within their remit and within the limits of their contract, has organisational and functional authority to oversee work activities and guarantees the implementation of any instructions they receive, by checking they are carried out correctly by employees, and the person who by virtue of their function has the authority to make decisions [1].

A supervisor is somebody who, within their remit, has the authority to provide instructions to other staff members.
This means that every staff member who has authority over at least one person counts as a supervisor.
This also applies to staff members who only have temporary authority over another person, for example while training a new employee.

Supervisors must...
- supervise each employee to ensure they follow and implement all legal duties and internal instructions with regard to occupational health and safety
- check that only the employees who have received sufficient and appropriate training enter areas in which they are exposed to serious and specific risks
- inform employees as quickly as possible about any serious and impending risk as well as any protective measures that have been or will be taken
- demand that employees follow all measures for safe behaviour in emergency situations. They additionally provide instructions to leave the workplace or hazard zone in case of serious, unavoidable risk, or not to resume work if the serious risk continues
- report any defect in work tools, appliances, or personal protective equipment to the employer or manager, as well as communicating any further risks encountered during work - and which they notice as a result of knowledge obtained through training - in a timely manner

Supervisors have to take specific training courses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: The employee

Employees are people who perform work for an employer

Definition
A person who, independent of their type of contract, performs a work activity within the organisation of a public or private employer, with or without pay, including in the course of learning a profession, a skill or trade; domestic workers and family caregivers are excluded from this definition  [1] .

The following people all have employee status within occupational health and safety:
Worker co-operators or employee shareholders, who do work for companies and co-operatives
students of high schools, universities, or professional development courses, where laboratories, machines, specific appliances, or chemical, physical, and biological agents, including display screen equipment, are used. This is strictly limited to the time period in which the students are actually using the aforementioned equipment or laboratories
anybody undertaking an internship or work placement, which aim to foster the regular alternation between education and work, or to support their career choice through direct contact with the working world
freelancers, i.e., staff who are not employed and perform independent activities. Nonetheless, the same regulations regarding protection from accidents at work and occupational diseases apply, provided that the activities take place (even partially) on the client’s premises
Volunteers of the National Fire Service and Civil Protection Department
People who carry out charitable activities (pursuant to Legislative Decree 468/1997)
Every employee is legally obliged to look after their own health and safety as well as the health and safety of all other people in the workplace who could be affected by their action or inaction, according to their own level of training and taking into account any instructions and tools received from the employer [2].
Employees have the following duties in the field of occupational health and safety:
Support the employer in the implementation of regulations for accident prevention and health protection

Safety at work is a shared responsibility
Safety and health protection at work is not just the employer’s responsibility.
Everybody must do their part to protect the health of every person in the company from harm.
Employees have to take care of their own safety and health to the best of their abilities and are not allowed to endanger others. For this reason, they have to support all measures for safety at work.
Moreover, they should be actively involved in making suggestions for the improvement of occupational health and safety.

The employee’s on-site knowledge should contribute to the improvement of occupational health and safety in the company.

Follow the employer’s instructions

Employees are required to follow instructions regarding safety and health protection from the employer, managers, and supervisors.
Some instructions might also be found in a works agreement.

Instructions that are adverse to safety and health are not to be followed.
Employees must refrain from carrying out haphazard activities or actions for which they are not authorised or with which they could endanger their own safety or the safety of other employees.

Use the provided personal protective equipment

The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is often legally required to protect employees from special and individual hazards in the workplace.
This is the case whenever technical and organisational measures are not sufficient to minimise the risk of an accident or injury.
The employer must examine all special hazards in their company during a risk assessment. The risk assessment informs the choice of PPE.
The employer must provide PPE free of charge and is responsible for keeping it in good condition.

The most common types of PPE are: head protection, foot protection, eye and face protection, and skin protection.

Report any defects in their workplace or work tools

Every accident in the workplace and every event that nearly leads to an accident, every direct hazard, as well as every defect discovered in a safety system, must be reported to the supervisor or the person in charge without delay.

When, during an event of imminent and significant hazard, the supervisor or the person in charge cannot be contacted, employees must themselves take the necessary measures to warn other employees and prevent any possible risk of injury or loss of life.
This must be based on any information and education they have received as well as any technical resources at their disposal.

Use safety devices correctly

Employees using work tools incorrectly can cause hazards to themselves as well as to other people (co-workers, clients, etc.).

As a rule, employees must use work tools and the safety devices belonging to them correctly and in accordance with the training and instructions they receive from the employer.

Safety devices must not be manipulated or destroyed.

Not place themselves in a situation which endangers them or others

This applies especially to the consumption of alcohol and any other intoxicating substances.

The employer is permitted to not entrust work to employees who are no longer capable of doing their work without endangering themselves or others as a result of the consumption of alcohol or any other intoxicating substances.

Undergo occupational medical surveillance where required

Employees who are employed to perform tasks which fall under the protection of occupational medicine (e.g. those who work with display screen equipment, those who are exposed to a specific risk such as noise, vibrations, etc.) must undergo preventive medical check-ups as well as follow prevention measures stipulated by occupational medicine.

The goal of this regular medical surveillance is the early detection and prevention of work-related illnesses.

Know and follow all measures to be taken during an emergency

Depending on the type of company, the quick and safe departure from workstations and rooms through escape routes and emergency exits must be ensured. Escape routes and emergency exits must also be clearly signposted and unobstructed.
All possible accident scenarios and their associated emergency measures are listed in an emergency plan.

Employees must know and follow all procedures for the safe evacuation of the building and measures for each specific possible emergency.

Notfallplan Bozen
Notfallplan Brixen
Notfallplan Bruneck
Take part in training and education programmes

Employees have the right

to a safe and healthy workplace
to safe work tools
to adequate information, education and training
to personal protective equipment, in the case of unavoidable hazards
to representation through a health and safety representative with regard to occupational health and safety
to work-related medical surveillance

Categories of employees with special protection:

Pregnant employees

Female employees have the right to special protection during pregnancy and until the seventh month after giving birth. As soon as an employee reports her pregnancy, the employer must take this factor into account and evaluate possible risky activities, which may require a change in her tasks or specific preventive and protective measures.

You can find more information about this in Italian or German on the website for the department of work of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano.

Employees under eighteen years of age

Employees under eighteen years of age have the right to special protection. As soon as an employer hires an employee under eighteen years of age, specific preventive and protective measures must be put in place.

If hazards occur or hazardous work activities are carried out, employing staff under the age of eighteen is forbidden.

You can find more information about this in Italian or German on the website for the department of work of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: The health and safety representative

Definition: The person elected or chosen to represent employees with regard to health and safety in the workplace
A health and safety representative must be elected or appointed in all companies or units. The health and safety representative can be internal or external.

In companies with 15 or fewer employees

Health and safety representatives are normally chosen by employees from amongst themselves.

In companies with more than 15 employees

Health and safety representatives are elected or appointed by the employees from trade union representatives in the company.
The employees elect a health and safety representative from amongst themselves if they do not have any trade union representation within their company
If no health and safety representative has been elected or appointed, an external health and safety representative takes on their functions.

Regional health and safety representative

A health and safety representative who is responsible for several companies within a region or business sector
Health and safety representatives for production units

Health and safety representatives for production units in which numerous organisations or construction sites are present, e.g. ports, particularly large construction sites, complex production sites, etc

one health and safety representative in companies with 200 or fewer employees
three health and safety representatives in companies with between 201 and 1000 employees
six health and safety representatives in companies with more than 1,000 employees*

(* In these companies the number of health and safety representatives will increase based on specifications in the collective bargaining agreements or inter-union agreement)

The health and safety representatives’ most important responsibilities

The health and safety representatives must have access to workplaces and receive information regarding risk assessments and the necessary protective measures to be taken. They are consulted with regard to the appointment of those involved with safety and health organisation and the organisation of the education and training of employees
