Title: Then and now

Comparing occupational health and safety:
THEN (from the 1950s to 1994) and NOW


THEN
Between the 1950s and when Legislative Decree 626/1994 came into force, hazards were defined exclusively by the legislature.
Numerous laws were passed to regulate specific types of work (especially work on construction sites and in industrial operations).
These laws were based purely on accident prevention.

NOW
According to current legislation, however, the employer is responsible for evaluating hazards.
On the basis of risk analysis and the risk assessment the employer takes the necessary health and safety measures for the protection of the employee.

THEN
The legislature enacted regulations for known hazards at work and defined the specific and narrow protective measures for each individual hazard.
The employer followed these regulations “blindly”.

NOW
The legislature defines general conditions to be met and establishes the minimum requirements for protective measures.
The employer must:
recognise the hazards, while evaluating and analysing the risks
determine and implement the protective measures
develop the safety and health organisation in their company

THEN
The law only required the employee to receive basic information on the hazards at work.
The employee just passively followed orders.

NOW
The employer is legally responsible for providing employees with targeted, appropriate information, education and training regarding current risks in the workplace.
The employee is actively involved in the safety and health organisation.
