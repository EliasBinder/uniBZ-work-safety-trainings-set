Summary

Measures for safety and health protection at work are important prerequisites for carrying out all types of work, and for ensuring success for a company.

This is the objective occupational health and safety aims to achieve with legal regulations.

Occupational health and safety no longer relates only to pure hazard avoidance and to the elimination of risks to the safety of the employee. It is mainly related to the preventive safeguarding of health and to humane work under constantly changing work and environment conditions: faster processes, new tasks and technologies, and more time pressure are only some of the indications of this.

In order to fulfil the modern requirements of occupational health and safety and guarantee the health and safety of all people in their workplace, employers and employees must realise the benefits of working together for forward-thinking occupational health and safety and a good, functional occupational health and safety management system.

The goals of occupational health and safety management are, among others:

compliance with all occupational health and safety regulations
the systematic interplay between all elements of occupational health and safety management
the continuous improvement of occupational health and safety performance
