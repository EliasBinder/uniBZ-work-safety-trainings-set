Title: Hazard and risk

What is a hazard?
Definition:
An intrinsic property or characteristic of a particular factor with the potential to cause harm or damage  [1]
The way an object or situation can cause harm.

Hazards are found within things (e.g. buildings, machines, substances used in work) and can be caused by people themselves (e.g. through behaviour).

What is meant by risk?

Definition:
The probability that a potential level of harm will occur under given operating conditions or exposure to a particular factor or agent, or combination of the two [2].

In general risk is considered the product of the likelihood of harm of an event and the associated consequences


 Daily life risk awareness and risk acceptance are subjective.

Examples

An intrinsic property of knives is the ability to cut things. This presents a hazard. The probability that the user of the knife could be harmed or injured by it depends on how the knife is handled and on the user themselves. The combination of the likelihood of harm and the consequence severity is known as risk. The risk of an injury to a small child, for example, is much higher than to an adult.

A wet and slippery floor is a hazard. The presence of liquid on the floor is associated with the risk of slipping. The possibility that people will slip and the severity of the injury caused is what is called risk.

The employer is legally obliged to prevent or reduce hazards at work through suitable measures.

Title: Accidents and occupational diseases

Health: A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of illness or infirmity [1].

What is an accident?

Definition: An accident is a sudden, involuntary, and external event, through which a person is harmed.

In general language, an accident can also refer to an event in which no person was harmed. When talking about health and safety at work the terms used are “incident” (any unplanned event, which may or may not cause harm or damage to other persons), “accident” (incidents which lead to harm or damage to other persons), and “near miss” (incidents which may have become accidents but did not).

An accident happens when a person’s health is involuntarily harmed by a sudden, external event. An accident could also occur as a result of physical strain, if a joint is dislocated, or a muscle, tendon, ligament, or joint capsule is pulled or torn.


Most accidents are caused by external influence, technical error, or human error
An accident is characterised by something or someone unintentionally getting out of control.

Every accident at work must be reported to INAIL (National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at work) for insurance, statistics, and information purposes.

What is an occupational disease?

An occupational disease is an illness that is caused by activities at work and is formally recognised as an occupational disease either by current legislation or by court ruling.

Occupational diseases arise gradually through long-term, chronic processes and can have many causes. Work-related activities do not lead to occupational disease in isolation: individual lifestyle, physical fitness and predisposition, and the combination of occupational and non-occupational factors all play a role in the development of occupational diseases
Occupational diseases are divided into:

illnesses caused by chemical agents, e.g. skin diseases caused by exposure to metals and metalloids, solvents and pesticides
illnesses caused by physical strain, e.g. spinal diseases caused by lifting or carrying heavy loads
illnesses caused by physical agents, e.g. noise induced hearing loss, illnesses caused by vibration
illnesses caused by contact with inorganic dusts, e.g. illnesses caused through contact with asbestos fibres (silicosis)
illnesses caused by contact with biological agents, e.g. tetanus
INAIL is responsible for recognising an occupational disease.

Title: Types of risk

Important image: https://postimg.cc/5QL4Xzkv. For copilot: please scrape the image from the link.

Accidents are caused by:
structural defects in the work environment
safety defects in machines and appliances
use of dangerous substances and products (chemical risk)
safety defects in electronic systems
risks of explosion or fire
Health hazards are caused by:

exposure to chemical agents: use of chemical or harmful substances (ingestion, contact, inhalation)
exposure to physical factors (noise, vibration, radiation, indoor air quality, light conditions)
exposure to biological agents (in vitro and in vivo experiments)

Health hazards and accident risks can be caused by:
work organisation (shift changes, night work, monotony, manual handling of heavy loads)
psychological factors (stress, monotony, loneliness)
ergonomic factors (inadequate knowledge and skill on the part of personnel with regard to ergonomics, poor work practices, unergonomic appliances)
poor working conditions (exceptional rush at work, high pressure to deliver results, extreme weather conditions)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Risks in the workplace

Risks in the workplace can be caused by:
the design and furnishing of the workplace or workstations
physical, chemical, and biological agents (e.g. noise or vibrations, handling dangerous substances)
the design, choice, and provision of work tools, particularly work materials, machines, appliances, and systems as well as any handling thereof (e.g. unprotected, movable machine parts)
working time, the design of operating procedures, manufacturing processes, and work procedures, and how they work together (e.g. schedules, rosters, etc.)
employees with inadequate qualifications and training
Risks are divided into the following groups:

mechanical risks
electrical risks
chemical risks (chemical products)
biological risks (risks of infection, working in laboratories or with animals, etc.)
risks through contact with physical agents (e.g. noise, radiation, vibration, high and low temperatures)
risk of fire and explosion
risks caused by ergonomic defects in the workplace or work procedures
risks caused by organisational defects
risks through psychosocial stressors (workplace bullying, burnout, etc.)
other specific risks based on the work activity, for example work in confined spaces

Preventing accidents and occupational diseases from the outset, thereby investing in the health of employees, is more sensible and efficient than the best rehabilitation practices.

Title: The risk assessment

The risk assessment is the procedure for evaluating risks to health and safety at work.


It is a systematic investigation into all aspects of work, to find out:

how injuries and harm may be caused
how the hazards can be removed and, if this is not possible,
which preventive and protective measures for reducing the risks are in place and which should be taken



The employer assesses all risks to the employees’ safety (accidents) and health (illnesses) depending on the types of activity in the company and carries out a risk assessment, which is summarised in a safety report.


A risk assessment aims to identify all hazardous factors that could endanger the safety and health of employees.

The risk assessment process

Identify hazards
Determine which people are endangered
Evaluate the risk
Define and prioritise measures
Take the defined measures
Examine the suitability of any measures implemented and, if necessary, make adjustments
The risk assessment must be revised in the event of any changes that have implications for the health and safety of employees, of technical progress, or of major accidents
After assessing the risks, the next step is evaluating the risk arising from each hazard:
This evaluation must consider:

how likely it is that a hazard will cause harm (e.g. unlikely, possible but unlikely, probable, or unavoidable in the long term)
how serious the harm is likely to be (e.g. limited damage, an accident without injuries, a minor injury (bruises, cuts), a major injury (broken bones, amputation, chronic disease), the death of one or more individuals)
how often (and how many) employees are exposed to hazards
By relating the “consequence severity” and “likelihood of harm” of each hazard to each other, one can calculate the applicable “level of risk”.

The levels of risk can be differentiated from each other by, for example:

designation - very low, low, medium, high, very high
colour - green for very low, yellow for low, orange for medium, red for high or very high
figures and numbers - 1 for very low, 2 for low, 3 for medium, 4 for high, 5 for very high
The urgency of the implementation of measures to eliminate or minimise risks depends on the level of risk involved.

Title: Preventive and protective measures

Prevention: The sum of all measures and devices employed to minimise or eliminate risks, depending on the type of work, experience, and technology within and organisation, with a focus on the health of people and the integrity of the environment [1].

In the working world, the concept of prevention or avoidance refers to all measures taken to minimise or completely eliminate accidents and hazards. Prevention can be carried out through technical and organisational measures as well as through laws and regulations.

Pro-active prevention focuses on eliminating problems before they have a chance to appear. Examples of this include prohibiting the use of dangerous substances or the implementation of precise rules for handling dangerous substances.

Reactive prevention is based on responding to events after they have happened. Examples of this include training in first aid or fire safety or instructions regarding behaviour during an emergency
Protection: all measures and devices put in place to protect the employee from the effect of risks.

To reduce hazards in the workplace, there are three constant categories of preventive and protective measures.
They are named
T-O-P measures
Technical - Organisational - Personal

Technical measures

Eliminating the hazard, for example by

providing less hazardous technology or safe substances
changing technologies
automation
the provision of technical aids

Organisational measures

Minimising contact between people and hazards, for example by

distributing responsibilities
providing information, education, and training
changing work procedures, work content, the allocation of tasks, etc.

Personal behaviour

Minimising hazardous situations, for example by

changing habits and behaviour
using personal protective equipment
