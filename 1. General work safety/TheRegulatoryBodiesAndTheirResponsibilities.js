Title: Occupational health and safety inspections

Technical health and safety inspectors supervise compliance with regulations for accident and fire prevention, noise protection as well as the regulations regarding hygiene in the workplace. They carry out inspections in companies, take measurements, establish protocols, write reports, and provide information about the field of occupational health and safety.

What happens when an inspection reveals a violation of one or more occupational health and safety regulations? (breach of law)


EXAMPLE:

The technical health and safety inspector notices something during supervision: a worker is driving a forklift in which the safety belt is broken.

This represents a hazardous situation.

The technical health and safety inspector charges the employer with failing to keep the forklift in working order, thereby failing to guarantee safety during its usage.

The penalty for this offence is three to six months imprisonment
OR
a fine of €2,740 to €7,014.40

The technical health and safety inspector requests that the employer ensures that the safety belt is repaired within a specific time period (e.g. within 30 to 60 days).
At the same time, the inspector sends notification to the Prosecutor’s Office.
During the time period allocated to fulfilling the inspector’s request, the criminal proceedings are suspended.
After the time limit is reached, the health and safety inspector checks if the belt has been repaired.
If the belt is repaired

the employer can pay one-quarter of the maximum fine through administrative channels within 30 days.
If the employer pays the fine within 30 days, the corresponding criminal charge is cancelled and the criminal case is archived.
